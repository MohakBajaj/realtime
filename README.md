# Upstash Realtime

The easiest way to add realtime features to any Next.js project.

![Project Image](https://github.com/upstash/realtime/blob/main/public/thumbnail.png)

## Features

- Setup takes 1-2 minutes
- Deploy anywhere Node.js runs: Vercel, Netlify, etc.
- 100% type-safe using zod v4
- Automatic connection management w/ delivery guarantee
- Built-in middleware for authentication
- Powered by Redis streams & server-sent events

## Installation

```bash
bun install @upstash/realtime
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Configure Upstash Redis

Upstash realtime is powered by Redis. We'll assume you already have the `@upstash/redis` package installed:

```ts
// lib/redis.ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

export const redis = new Redis({
  // ðŸ‘‡ grab these from the Upstash Redis dashboard
  url: "https://striking-osprey-20681.upstash.io",
  token: "AVDJAAIjcDEyZ...",
})
```

### 2. Define event schema

Define the structure of realtime events in your app.

```ts
// lib/realtime.ts
import { Realtime, InferRealtimeEvents } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { redis } from "./redis"
import z from "zod"

// ðŸ‘‡ later triggered with `realtime.notification.alert.emit()`
const schema = {
  notification: z.object({
    alert: z.string(),
  }),
}


export const realtime = new Realtime({ schema, redis })
export type RealtimeEvents = InferRealtimeEvents<typeof realtime>
```

### 3. Create realtime API endpoint

Create your realtime endpoint under `/api/realtime/route.ts`. It's important that your route matches this path exactly.

```ts
// api/realtime/route.ts
import { handle } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { realtime } from "@/lib"

export const GET = handle({ realtime })
```

### 4. Emit events

```ts
await realtime.notification.alert.emit("Hello world")
```

### 5. Subscribe to events

```tsx
"use client"

import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

export default function MyComponent() {
  useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
    events: {
      notification: {
        // ðŸ‘‡ 100% type-safe
        alert: (data) => console.log(data),
      },
    },
  })

  return <div>Listening for events...</div>
}
```

## Usage

### Serverless Configuration

Serverless functions have execution time limits. The client automatically reconnects before timeout, with Redis Streams guaranteeing that no message is lost.

**If you deploy to Vercel:** Make sure [fluid compute](https://vercel.com/docs/fluid-compute) is enabled for your project. This allows very high timeout limits, even for free users. Also, your functions will not be billed based on open time, but on active CPU time (only while realtime messages are processed).

```ts
export const realtime = new Realtime({
  schema,
  redis,

  // ðŸ‘‡ Set to - Vercel free plan: 300; Vercel pro plan: 800
  maxDurationSecs: 300,
})
```

Match this to your API route timeout:

```ts
// api/realtime/route.ts

// ðŸ‘‡ Set to - Vercel free plan: 300; Vercel pro plan: 800
export const maxDuration = 300

export const GET = handle({ realtime })
```

**Vercel Note:** With fluid compute (default), you're only billed for active CPU time, not connection duration. This makes Upstash Realtime very cost-efficient.

### Channels

Scope events to channels or rooms:

```ts
await realtime.channel("room-123").notification.alert.emit("Hello")
```

```tsx
import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
  channel: "room-123",
  events: {
    notification: {
      alert: (data) => console.log(data),
    },
  },
})
```

### Connection Control

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(true)

const { status } = useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
  enabled,
  events: {
    notification: {
      alert: (data) => console.log(data),
    },
  },
})
```

## Advanced

### Middleware Authentication

Protect your realtime endpoints with custom authentication logic.

```ts
import { realtime } from "@/lib"
import { handle } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { currentUser } from "@/auth"

export const GET = handle({
  realtime,
  middleware: async ({ request, channel }) => {
    const user = await currentUser(request)

    if (channel === user.id) {
      return
    }

    if (channel !== user.id) {
      return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
    }
  },
})
```

The middleware function receives:

- `request`: The incoming Request object
- `channel`: The channel the client is attempting to connect to

Return `undefined` or nothing to allow the connection. Return a `Response` object to block the connection with a custom error.
